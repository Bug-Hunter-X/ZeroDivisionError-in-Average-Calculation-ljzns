# Python Bug: ZeroDivisionError in Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common coding error in Python: a `ZeroDivisionError` that occurs when calculating the average of an empty list.  The initial code lacks proper error handling for this edge case.

The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling, demonstrating how to avoid this error.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in programming.  Always consider edge cases and potential exceptions when writing your code to prevent unexpected crashes or incorrect results.
